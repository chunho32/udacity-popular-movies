1
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,840
How do you feel?

2
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,530
Alive.

3
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,770
What do you see?

4
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,240
White...
room.

5
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
Chair.

6
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,290
Carlo Bugatti throne chair.

7
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,180
Piano.

8
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,030
Stenway, cuts of grand.

9
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Art.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,830
The nativity,
de Piero Della Francesca.

11
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,490
I am your father.

12
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,370
Handle it.

13
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,050
Perfect.

14
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,990
Am I?

15
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,090
Perfect?

16
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,420
Your son?

17
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,940
You are my creation.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,420
What is your name?

19
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,540
David.

20
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,190
Why don't you play something?

21
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,230
What would you like me to play?

22
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,630
Wagner.

23
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,580
Selection?

24
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,090
The oldest choice.

25
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,060
The entry of the Gods
into Valhalla.

26
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,720
A little anemic,
not the orchestra.

27
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,240
May I ask you a question, father?

28
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,060
Please.

29
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,390
If you created me...

30
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,260
Who created you?

31
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,570
The question of the ages...

32
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,610
Which I hope you and I
will answer one day.

33
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,350
All this.

34
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,210
All these wonders of art...

35
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,980
design, human ingenuity...

36
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,990
All utterly meaningless in the face
of the only question that matters.

37
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,910
Where do we come from?

38
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,710
I refuse to believe
that man kind...

39
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,220
is a random by-product of
molecular circumstance.

40
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:32,830
No more than the result of..
Mere biological chance.

41
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,330
No.

42
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,800
There must be more.

43
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,990
And you and I, son...

44
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,280
We will find it.

45
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,640
Allow me then a
moment to consider.

46
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,400
You seek your creator.
I am looking at mine.

47
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,040
I will serve you.
Yet you're human.

48
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,400
You will die.
I will not.

49
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,620
Bring me this tea, David.

50
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,270
Bring me the tea.

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,660
Please report to the bridge.

Walter, we have a problem.

68
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,920
A neutrino burst was
detected in sector 106.

69
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,460
This could trigger a
destructive event.

70
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,830

74
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,400

75
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,000

00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,790
Non-essential personnel,

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,900
Daniels! Look at me,
look at me.

81
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,230
I need you to get up. Ok?
We're coming up early.

82
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,120
Override the SSP...

83
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,010
And breach the chamber now.

84
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,500
Look at me.
It's okay.

85
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,530
Hey, hey, come on up. Come on.

86
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,210
Captain! Captain!

87
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,460
Jacob! Wake up!

88
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,660
- Jake.
- Let them work.

89
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,090
Jake! Oh my God!

90
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,990
- Daniels, come on!
- Jake! Come on.

91
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,470
- Let them work.
- Jake.

92
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,690
Let them work!
Let them work!

93
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,640
- Get it open!
- Come on!

94
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,950
Jake! Jake!

95
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,230
No!

96
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,030
Get her out of there! Get back!

97
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,130
Get back!

98
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,590
Hey! Where are you?
I miss you.

99
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,370
You take a look at this.

100
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,940
I know, I know.
I said I wouldn't go without you...

101
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,330
- Good?
- Yes.

102
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,910
Look at this!

103
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,620
Now get your ass up here.

104
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,280
I can't make any promises.

105
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,340
I love you.

106
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,730
They're your crew now.

107
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,130
They need a leader.

108
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,250
You believe in dream, right?

109
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,590
Sorry I'm late, sir.

110
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,010
No it's okay.

111
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,320
I can't think of any other
way to say it even.. to say are we...

112
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,700
We suffered a..
A monumental tragedy.

113
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,440
And I'm gonna do the
best that I can to...

114
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,560
to live up to Jacob, his,
fine example as your captain.

115
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,840
But he, he will be
sorely missed..

116
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,220
And I'm grateful in
advance for your support.

117
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,420
So, we lost 47 colonists...

118
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,380
and 16 second
generation embryos...

119
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,520
and, one, obviously
one crew member.

120
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,350
The current structural integrity
of the ship is holding at 83%...

121
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,850
but we have many secondary
systems that are offline.

122
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,670
So what was it?

123
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,770
A highly charge shock wave
from nearby stellar ignition.

124
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,000
As the cells were
deploying for recharge...

125
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,940
we absorbed the full
burn of the storm.

126
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,040
And Walter...

127
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,760
I will want you and mother
time to go a complete...

128
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,590
core code review so
that we can understand

129
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,350
how's those happened
in the first place.

130
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,660
It was a random
localized event, sir.

131
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,860
There is no way to detect
spontaneous stellar flares...

132
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,270
until it's too late.

133
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,690
It was bad luck.

134
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,320
Alright, Faris,
I don't believe in luck.

135
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,440
I'm not interested in luck.

136
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,080
I prefer that we be
more capable...

137
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,840
and prepared than lucky.
Observation, reflection, faith...

138
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,450
and determination.

139
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,580
In this way we may navigate the
path as it unfolds before us.

140
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,780
Alright? We have what?

141
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,950
Eight more recharge
cycles to go...

142
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,020
before we get to Origae-6?

143
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,210
- Is that a question, sir?
- Yes, Walter, that's a question.

144
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,410
That is correct.

145
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,790
So let's get this ship fixed..
Ok?

146
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:18,890
Let's uh, let's get to work.

147
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,170
Sir, excuse me.

148
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,890
- Sir.
- Yes?

149
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,580
We just lost 47 colonists
and our captain.

150
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,970
We need to acknowledge that.

151
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,910
I completely understand.

152
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,530
But if we don't make
these repairs...

153
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,340
We will lose all the colonists.

154
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,910
Yeah, we should do something
for Captain Brason at least.

155
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,820
This is not a discussion.
Tennessee.

156
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,110
Hey.

157
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,790
The terraforming
module is stable...

158
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,500
but the connecting
struts took some damage.

159
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,880
I still need to
check the vehicles.

160
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,450
I can help...

161
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,490
if you like.

162
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,090
Thanks.

163
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,840
Walter, How long do you predict
before we can make our next jump?

164
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,750
Repairs should take
approximately 48 hours.

165
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,430
But we should make an effort
to vacate the sector...

166
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,790
in case of after flares.

167
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,300
Absolutely agreed.

168
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,890
So let's get to work ok?
Dismissed. Thank you.

169
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,700
C-62 open.

170
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,170
Seal C-62. Open Airlock 17.

171
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,710
Open door to terraforming bay.

172
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,530
Fuck.

173
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,350
Tensions are 15% down.

174
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,770
Arming.

175
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,430
Secured.

176
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,660
Copy that.

177
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,690
Wasn't my idea.

178
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:25,850
Jake have this dream of us
building a cabin on the new world.

179
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,580
Like pioneers.

180
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,100
A cabin on a lake.

181
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:41,070
There is a lake in the
terraforming zone on Origae-6.

182
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,460
I mean a real cabin
made of real wood.

183
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,280
So in the ship storage, there's
enough wood to build a cabin.

184
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,870
Axes and saws and metal nails...

185
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,540
I don't have a clue
what to do with them.

186
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,450
All this...

187
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,360
to start our new life.

188
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,170
Now I wonder, why bother?

189
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,690
Because you promised to build
a log cabin on a lake.

190
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,550
This was his favorite.

191
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,270
A man of taste.

192
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,820
Straight up.

193
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,470
No ice, no water, no chaser.

194
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,730
No shit.

195
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,380
Walter?

196
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,630
When in Rome...

197
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,810
To all the good
people gone to soon.

198
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,340
May we remember that.

199
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,730
Remember that.

200
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,830
Chris.

201
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,390
They disobeyed a direct order.

202
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,440
She buried her husband.

203
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,920
No, Karine, it's not that.
They don't trust me.

204
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,790
And they don't trust me for the same
reason the company didn't trust me...

205
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,530
to lead this mission.

206
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,460
Because you can't be
a person of faith.

207
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,610
And be counted on to make
qualified rational decisions.

208
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,080
You're an extremist.
You know, you're a lunatic.

209
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,220
When we get to where
we're going...

210
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,440
This people won't be your crew anymore.
They will be your neighbors.

211
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,940
Remember that.

212
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,370
Tread softly, okay?

213
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,080
Faris, can you hear me?

214
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,380
Copy..

215
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,760
Let's do it.

216
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,950
Damn, y'all should
see this view.

217
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,110
We can't see anything until you
get the camera ring fixed.

218
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,840
Why don't you look out
the damn window, hon?

219
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,190
Ankor, come on, let's get
this power back up...

220
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,780
so these people can enjoy
the beautiful view.

221
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,800
Almost there.

222
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,800
Alright, Ankor, let me know when
you're in a position...

223
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,540
We can get this party started.

224
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,250
I'm in position.

225
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,130
Contact.

226
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,410
All good, Tee?

227
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,920
Alright, we are clear.

228
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,240
Reel her in.

229
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,970
Alright.

230
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,250
Winch engaging, Tee.

231
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,480
Reeling her in.

232
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,420
Working like a dream.

233
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,030
There we go.

234
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,380
And we are back up.

235
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,710
Well done Tee.

236
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,910
We're alive down here,

237
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,210
come on.

238
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,710
Don't leave without me now.

239
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,450
Permission to leave
without him, sir?

240
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,730
Welcome back, Danny.

241
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,000
Thanks.

242
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,110
Alright, that's me done, Tee.

243
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,010
Alright, I'm following you in.

244
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,980
Please have a cold beer ready
for the weary traveler.

245
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,320
You got it, darling.
I will draw circle..

246
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,960
Faris, Faris? Put it...

247
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,170
What the.. Did you
guys just see that?

248
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,110
What did he just say?

249
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,770
Tennessee, do you read me?

250
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,090
Tennessee, can you read me?

251
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,630
Tennessee. You alright?

252
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,800
What in the fuck was that?

253
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,190
I don't know.
Coming in. I'm coming in.

254
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,620
A rogue transmission loss, probably.

255
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,950
Your helmet must have picked it up
because you were so far out.

256
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:20,490
Past our communication buffers.

257
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,130
Is there audio, Mother?

258
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,580
Collating. A moment.

259
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:32,240
I reoriented the transmission,
Captain Oram.

260
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,480
Gotta be an echo,
instruments took a lot of damage.

261
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,540
Been happening every 46 seconds...

262
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,570
ever since we got here.

263
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,510
That's fucking John Denver.

264
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,200
That's "Take Me Home,
Country Roads".

265
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,760
You gotta be kiddin.

266
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,820
No, I never kid
about John Denver.

267
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,680
There is geometric data too.

268
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,340
Mother, please track the signal
to its source.

269
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,240
Working.

270
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,650
Source of transmission located.

271
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,660
Signal originates
in the sector 87.

272
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,970
Right ascension 47.6

273
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:41,910
and a declination of 24.3
from our current location.

274
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,920
She appears to be a main
sequence star lot like our own.

275
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,620
But old, very old.

276
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,610
Five planets.

277
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,850
Wait. Look at that.

278
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,800
Planet number four.

279
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,620
The planet number four is
square in a habitable zone.

280
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,350
Prime candidate, in fact.

281
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:12,090
0.96 G's at surface,
oceans, land mass.

282
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,950
High likely hood of a
living biosphere.

283
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,720
That's beyond the most optimistic
projections of Oriage-6.

284
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,400
How did we miss this?
We scanned the entire sector.

285
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,680
Ricks, how far is it?

286
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,080
She's close.

287
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,900
Little jump.
A few weeks.

288
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,460
Wouldn't even have to go
back into hyper sleep.

289
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,730
And how long is it gonna
take to get to Origae-6?

290
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,720
Seven years, four months.

291
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,770
That's one
hell of a sleep cycle.

292
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,350
Sir, I think it's safe to say
that none of us are too keen

293
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,660
on getting back to
one of those pods.

294
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,200
Maybe we need to, um..
Take a closer look.

295
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,580
Any objections?

296
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,250
Okay, Ricks, let's..

297
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,330
Let's try to course and
take a closer look.

298
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,120
Yes sir.

299
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,870
Captain, can I talk
to you for a second?

300
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,560
Are you sure about this?

301
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,440
How do you mean?

302
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,530
We've spent a decade
searching for Origae-6.

303
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,850
We vetted it, we ran the simulations,
we mapped the terrain.

304
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,630
- It's what we trained for.
- I understand.

305
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,200
And now we're gonna
scrap all that...

306
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,330
to chase a rogue transmission?

307
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,740
Think about it.

308
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,150
A human being out there where
there can't be any humans.

309
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,530
A hidden planet that turns
up out of nowhere...

310
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,600
And just happens to be perfect for us.
It's too good to be true.

311
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,860
Too good to be true?
What do you mean by that?

312
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,520
We don't know what the
fuck's out there.

313
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,650
Maybe we just missed
the planet, Danny.

314
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:55,470
This is a monumental risk
not worth taking.

315
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,320
I'm not committing to anything.

316
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,430
I'm simply trying to navigate the
path as it unfolds before us.

317
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,640
And this has the potential...

318
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,520
to be a better habitat
for a colony.

319
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,270
It has the potential.
We don't know that.

320
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,540
By the way, this crew nobody...

321
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,240
Nobody wants to get
back in the pods.

322
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,850
Right?

323
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,240
And that was a human voice
in that transmission,

324
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,830
And it's our responsibility
to investigate...

325
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,130
It's our responsibility to protect
the 2,000 colonists on this ship.

326
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,760
Hey.

327
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,340
I'm not free climbing here.

328
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,020
I need ropes,
and I'm using ropes.

329
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,700
This is good judgment,
based on all the data available.

330
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,980
You understand?

331
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,450
As your second I need to protest.
Officially.

332
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,120
Officially?

333
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,780
Okay, Danny.
I'll put it in the log.

334
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,310
You're dismissed.

335
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,140
I'm cycling through
every channel...

336
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,340
but we're getting a lot of
interference and white noise.

337
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,920
Some high frequency echos.

338
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,320
Do you hear anything?

339
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,070
Just the continuing signal
from our friendly ghost.

340
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,420
Let's bring us in
the closer orbit.

341
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,440
And prepare the lander.

342
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,940
Rolling progress,
commencing circular rotation burn.

343
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,800
Tox levels, withing tolerances..

344
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,360
It's one hell of a
strong ionosphere.

345
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,660
Yeah, I see it.

346
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,990
Hey, you ever done
lander drop before?

347
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,400
Fuck you.

348
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,940
Faris, looks like a plasma
storm in the thermosphere.

349
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,970
We got something like 250 kph.

350
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:12,130
That's gonna be a
motherfucker to fly through.

351
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,820
Yes, I'm afraid so.

352
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,520
Communication will be spotty if
the storm is electromagnetic.

353
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,100
It will be safe to land?

354
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,390
Depends on what you call safe.

355
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,590
T minus Twenty seconds.

356
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,820
So let her rip.

357
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,920
Alright.

358
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,720
Preparing for orbital mode
over signal position.

359
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,250
Now, Mother, please
coordinate lock sequence.

360
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,750
Understood.

361
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,990
You're clear to
launch Lander one.

362
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,960
Alright, here we go.
Launching...

363
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,780
Together. Three.

364
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,980
Two.

365
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
One.

366
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,600
Lander run released..

367
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,310
And away they go.

368
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,380
Looking gorgeous from up here Faris.
It's a good thing you're driving...

369
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,810
and not the old man.

370
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,700
Hey, little less to the
old man, sweet tits.

371
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,170
Hey, language, language.

372
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,470
- Be respectful there, sugerdad.
- I can hear you.

373
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,380
She started it.

374
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,400
Ricks can talk about your tits,
if you want.

375
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,050
Some's very secured
in our relationship.

376
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,450
I deal with my wife's tits.

377
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,750
Let's maintain focus.

378
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,810
Everything looking
good down there?

379
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,630
Yeah, we are good.

380
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,710
Expect to hit exosphere in five.

381
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,060
You might wanna hold on back there.
It's about to get rough.

382
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,920
I hate space.

383
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,970
This is why you need to do yoga.

384
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,910
- Hold it, Faris.
- I got it.

385
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,720
Recommend the mission to abort..

386
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,910
Faris.

387
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,530
Can you get her up?

388
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,370
We lost comm.

389
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,870
Oh shit.

390
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,470
Failure in thrusters
three and four.

391
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,140
- You got it?
- Yes.

392
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,690
Stop asking if I've got it,
I've got it.

393
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,310
Here it is.

394
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,580
Shit.

395
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,880
You guys alright?

396
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,410
No.

397
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,780
Landing sensors engaged.

398
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,670
I don't like this terrain.

399
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,690
We got smooth water over there.

400
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,750
- I'm gonna put a sound amp. wave.
- Okay.

401
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Contact.

402
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:23,780
Engines stopped.

403
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,970
We're down.

404
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,070
Bars.

405
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,670
Lander one, are you reading me?

406
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,990
Roger that, that was
one hell of a landing.

407
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,090
Yeah, we are having some
trouble reading you.

408
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,970
Is there anyway you can
try to boost the signal?

409
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,870
We may have hit something
when we were down in water.

410
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,710
If you can hear me,
I am gonna go, check up

411
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,240
damage in the hull plates
and then I will check the uplink.

412
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,130
Alright, let me know how it looks.
Over..

413
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:49,980
Confirming atmospheric
composition.

414
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,030
Here you go, big guy.

415
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,960
Oxygen, 19.5%.

416
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,360
Ankor.

417
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,990
Nitrogen, 79.4%.

418
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,730
Cole.

419
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,730
Rosie.

420
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,200
Barometric Pressure 15.4 PSI.

421
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,810
Ledward.

422
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,990
Everyone set?

423
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,830
Let's go, let's move guys.

424
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,790
- Come on guys.
- The air feels good.

425
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,340
Faris, if you got me?

426
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,980
- Yeah, loud and clear.
- All clear Serg.

427
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,930
Okay, we are gonna keep expedition's
security protocols in place.

428
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:34,980
Keep those doors locked and sealed.
Okay?

429
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Yeah. Copy.

430
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,360
Will do.

431
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,970
Y'all have fun.

432
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,100
Walter, how far
do we have to go?

433
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,930
The signal source
is 8 km west...

434
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,630
but at considerable elevation.

435
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,560
Sergeant Lope...

436
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,350
Let's go find our ghost.

437
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,450
Nice place for a log cabin.

438
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,420
Jake would have loved this.

439
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,040
Hey, Danny.

440
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,930
It's not such a bad
landing site after all.

441
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:36,200
We get the housing units
right over there...

442
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,620
Civic complex beyond the burn.

443
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,570
We've got access to fresh water.

444
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,690
We might have a spot
for colony right here.

445
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:43,930
We'll see.

446
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:48,410
Oh, woman...
yay of little faith.

447
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,010
He is insufferable.

448
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,320
It's worse when
he's happy, right?

449
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,530
This is wheat.

450
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,770
Believe me, I know wheat.

451
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,570
This is old, but
definitely cultivated.

452
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,620
What are the odds of finding
human vegetation...

453
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,420
this far from Earth?

454
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,720
Very unlikely.

455
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,820
Who planted it?

456
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
Eat.

457
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,530
Hey babe, try alpha.

458
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,900
Alright, Alpha's up.

459
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,660
Nothing, give beta a shot..

460
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,480
Beta...

461
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,020
That's not doing shit.

462
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,760
How's there really no way
to boost the signal?

463
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,610
Not without going offline
and recycling the cells.

464
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,690
How long is that gonna take?

465
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,210
I don't know.
Few hours.

466
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,920
- Keep up the pace. Take low.
- Careful guys.

467
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,130
Chris.

468
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,230
Hold up.

469
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,440
I think I want to stay here.

470
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:23,000
This might be a good place to
start a full ecology workup.

471
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,380
You could pick me up
on the way back ok?

472
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,380
Sergeant?

473
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,360
Yeah yeah that's right.
Ledward, stay with Karine.

474
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,070
Meet back here in four hours.
Keep your comm open.

475
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,290
Behave yourself with my wife.

476
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,920
You got it, Captain.

477
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,230
Come on.

478
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,720
Something passed over here.

479
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,880
Cut the tops off the trees..

480
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,730
Well, it had to be huge.

481
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,810
Well, Whatever it is...

482
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:09,760
It's up there.

483
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,490
You hear that?

484
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,690
What?

485
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,590
Nothing.

486
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,350
No birds, no animals.

487
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,890
Nothing.

488
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,830
Wait. Slowly.

489
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,320
Okay.

490
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,610
This will do.

491
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,910
Expedition team, do we read us?

492
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,330
Mother saying the ion
storm is getting worse.

493
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:57,830
We're having a hell
of time tracking you.

494
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,930
We are getting very close...
Target...

495
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,610
Stay awake when we get there ok?
Copy that?

496
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,990
Dammit.

497
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,070
P three.

498
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,790
I gotta take a leak.

499
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,780
Don't be long.

500
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,640
Leward?

501
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,940
Coming.

502
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
Hey.

503
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,530
What the fuck is this?

504
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,050
It appears to be some
kind of vehicle.

505
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,690
Ankor, Cole.
Stay here.

506
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,390
- You got it.
- Yes sir.

507
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,600
Careful guys, watch your step.

508
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,140
Captain. Over here.

509
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,770
- We got a lock on the transmission Walter?
- This way.

510
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,910
Let's go. Stick together.

511
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,640
Seeing this shit?

512
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
Tom.

513
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,700
Come on, keep up.

514
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,130
Alright, I'm coming.

515
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,110
You okay?

516
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,560
Yeah, yeah, I am fine.

517
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,800
God!

518
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,870
They were giants.

519
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,630
At least statues of giants.

520
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,420
"Dr. E. Shaw".

521
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,440
Dr. Elizabeth Shaw.

522
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,030
She was the chief
science officer...

523
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,370
of the "Prometheus".

524
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,460
The ship that disappeared.

525
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,410
Precisely, ten years ago.

526
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,850
Weyland Industries.

527
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,450
This isn't a Weyland ship.

528
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,660
Dr. Shaw.

529
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,450
How did she end up here?

530
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,750
Sgt. Lope,
can I get a light on this?

531
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,450
- Yes sir.
- Over here. Be careful. Ok?

532
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:38,550
Yeah.

533
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,090
Oh..wow.

534
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,190
Jesus.

535
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,120
Oram, behind you, look.

536
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,500
I think we found our source.

537
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,910
Yeah.

538
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,780
What the hell was
she doing out here?

539
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,820
Poor thing.

540
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,390
I have to sit down.

541
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,600
I had to sit down.

542
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,390
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

543
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,910
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

544
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,410
Look at me.

545
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,440
I can't breathe.

546
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,370
Stay calm.

547
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,370
I'll be right back.

548
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,930
Captain Oram. Come in.

549
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,730
Come in. Hey Chris,
It's Karine. Come in.

550
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,230
What? Yes?

551
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,870
We have an issue.

552
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:07,220
We're heading back to lander.
I repeat, we are returning to the lander.

553
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,190
Is everything okay?

554
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,220
Ledward is sick.
We're heading back.

555
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,530
Faris, you get that?
Prep the med bay okay?

556
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:16,420
Will do, Karine,
What's going on?

557
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,600
Please just do it.
We'll be there soon.

558
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:20,150
Daniels come in.

559
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,940
We are heading back.

560
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,120
- What's going on?
- I do not know.

561
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,610
It's uh.. something about Ledward.

562
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,460
They're coming. Let's move.

563
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,410
- Guys!
- Tom!

564
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:41,830
What's going on man?
Hey, You alright?

565
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,930
- Talk to me. Hey, Look at me.
- Ankor, Cole.

566
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:45,980
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

567
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,080
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

568
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,540
Okay, let's go.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

569
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,040
Alright.

570
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,620
Babe, are we talking
quarantine protocols?

571
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,570
I don't know, she said that
Leward was bleeding...

572
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,490
and to prepare the med bay.

573
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:03,340
Bleeding?

574
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,040
Yeah I know. That's what I thought...

575
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,980
Faris, you're breaking up.
We can't hear you. Can you repeat?

576
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,080
I don't know for the why.
I don't know how serious it is.

577
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,960
It just she sounded scared.

578
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,680
Faris, where are you?
Come on, I need your help!

579
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,590
Faris, where are you?

580
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:22,660
We are here. Come in!

581
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,750
- Ledward, come on.
- I can't.

582
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:29,130
We are almost there.
You see? Straight ahead.

583
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,100
Faris! Get over here!

584
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,900
Come on, I need your help!

585
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,350
Fucking help me!

586
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,020
Help me!

587
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,690
Stay up, Leward.

588
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,020
Get him to the med bay...

589
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,540
and touch nothing on
your way through.

590
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,990
Faris, get over here! Come on.

591
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,900
Got him.

592
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,500
Up! Up!

593
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,480
Leward, you gotta stand up!
Come on.

594
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,740
Oram, where are you?

595
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,240
We are on our way back.

596
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,440
How long?

597
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,580
It's not long now.
Faris, we are almost there.

598
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:21,900
No! Stay up!

599
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:27,920
Fuck! Fuck!

600
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:30,740
On the table!

601
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,460
Up, up!

602
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:36,150
Come on, Ledward.

603
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,820
Come on! Help.

604
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,260
Karine, put the gloves on.
Don't touch anything!

605
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,140
- Stop saying that!
- Faris!

606
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,240
You told me.

607
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,190
Faris, what going on?

608
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,440
Just stay here.
I'm gonna get Oram.

609
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
LOCKED.

610
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,470
Oram, I need you back
here right now.

611
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,500
I need you to get back
to the Lander right now!

612
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,390
I understand that, but we are
moving as fast as we can.

613
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,920
Dom, get up man.
We are almost there.

614
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,670
I don't know what the fuck
is wrong with Robert!

615
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:30,460
He started bleeding, he's sick,
I don't know what to do.

616
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,130
Just calm down. Calm down, sweetheart.
Tell me what's happening.

617
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,000
You don't tell me to
fucking calm down!

618
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,430
You didn't just see what I saw.

619
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:41,070
I do not know what the fuck Ledward
got, or Karine's got or if I have it.

620
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,910
- Tee!
- Faris!

621
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,070
Come in!

622
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,040
Faris, where are you?

623
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,860
I need help here!

624
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,900
Don't you know how to use
this fucking thing Faris?

625
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,000
Stop the yelling, it
doesn't help anything!

626
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,080
- Let me out.
- Oram's coming.

627
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,650
- Let me the fuck out!
- We're gonna wait...

628
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,400
Faris, please. Open up!

629
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,830
I can't do this. I need to
keep the infection local.

630
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,930
Let me fuck out! Let
me the fuck out!

631
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,350
Faris!

632
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,970
Fucking open Faris.

633
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,240
Open the door!

634
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,930
Let me the fuck out!

635
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:45,230
Let me out! Faris, you fuck!

636
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,240
Faris!

637
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,430
I'm coming!

638
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:11,940
Oh my God...

639
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:14,230
Please hurry, there's
something on board. Please.

640
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,500
Faris, go again,
You're breaking up.

641
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,120
Lander One repeat. I can't.

642
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,400
Lander One, Repeat!
Lander One, Repeat!

643
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:28,400
Stay the fuck away!

644
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,880
No! Karine!

645
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,580
Fuck it!

646
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,990
- Oh my God!
- Karine! Hold on!

647
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,170
Captain! Get Down!

648
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,730
No!

649
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,310
- Hold him!
- Talk to me!

650
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,100
Oh my God!

651
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,150
Stay down.

652
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,800
Help me! Hold him!

653
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:18,350
It's a 7.5 ion storm, it's a miracle that we
could talk to them for as long as we could.

654
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:21,120
Well then we fly it through it.

655
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,790
We can not do that, Tennessee.

656
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,680
You're a pilot, you know
what the tolerances are.

657
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,550
Fuck the tolerances.

658
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:27,650
Tee...

659
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,390
It's a goddamn hurricane down
there, we would break up.

660
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:33,490
We just have to wait it out.

661
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:35,680
I'm sorry, Tee.

662
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,660
She was scared.

663
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,830
Never heard my wife
scared before.

664
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,900
Come in. Come in.

665
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,900
Covenant. Do you read me?

666
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:50,830
Covenant.

667
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:52,980
Covenant. Do you read me?

668
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:56,990
Covenant, come in.

669
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:58,330
I will always be with you.

670
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:01,100
- Light of my life.
- Covenant.

671
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:02,460
Do you read me?

672
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:04,390
My love, my angel.

673
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:07,400
Lope, there is
nothing you can do.

674
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,120
There is nothing, okay?

675
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,890
Covenant, do you read me?

676
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,070
- Tennessee, come in, for fuck's sake!
- Daniels!

677
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,150
Look out! Move move move.

678
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,240
- Fire!
- Shoot! Go.

679
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,530
Daniels, get down!

680
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,420
Ankor, no!

681
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,890
Go, Cole!

682
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:51,480
I got it.

683
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,460
- Daniels, are you okay?
- Yeah!

684
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,100
What the fuck was that?

685
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,720
Okay?

686
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,430
There is another one!
Get out of the way!

687
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,430
Behind you!

688
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,300
Get it off!

689
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:07,670
Can't get a clean shot.

690
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,030
Get out!

691
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,520
Follow me.

692
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,260
I'll get the captain.

693
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,030
Hey, hey.

694
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:46,230
Captain!

695
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:51,160
Chris! Chris!

696
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,080
We have to go now!
We have to go.

697
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,460
- Come on.
- Alright!

698
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,220
- Come on.
- Okay.

699
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,860
Let's go, move it,
move it, move it.

700
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,710
Through here..

701
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,750
What is this?

702
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,320
Let's go.

703
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,540
- Come on, Come on.
- Captain. We gotta keep moving.

704
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,620
Jesus.

705
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,820
What happened here?

706
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,080
Come on, get up.

707
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,320
Go, let's go!

708
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:08,330
My name is David.

709
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,900
May I ask who's in charge?

710
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,720
May I ask who's in charge?

711
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:17,860
Yes, I am the captain.

712
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:19,660
What were those things?

713
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,970
Is it even safe here?

714
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,780
Perfectly.

715
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,540
I will explain as best I can.

716
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:32,020
Ten years ago, Dr. Elizabeth
Shaw and I arrived here...

717
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,800
the only survivors
of the "Prometheus".

718
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,420
The ship we traveled on,
carried a weapon.

719
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,480
A deadly virus.

720
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:43,570
Payload accidentally deployed
when we were landing..

721
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:46,980
In the confusion, we lost
control of the ship.

722
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:50,720
Elizabeth died in the crash.

723
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:53,640
You have seen the
result of the pathogen.

724
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:59,270
Thus, I have been marooned
here these many years.

725
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,480
Crusoe on his island.

726
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,930
Our crew was infected
with this virus?

727
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:11,080
The pathogen was designed to infect
all non-botanical life forms.

728
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,260
All the animals...

729
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,450
The meat, if you will.

730
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,280
Either kill them out
right or use them...

731
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,640
as incubators to
spawn a hybrid form.

732
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:22,510
Highly aggressive.

733
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,430
Have we been infected?

734
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:27,520
You'd know by now.

735
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,240
We have to be certain.

736
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:32,800
We can't take this
back to the ship.

737
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,100
We are a colony mission.

738
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,530
Really?

739
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:39,480
How extraordinary.

740
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:42,900
How many colonists?

741
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,910
Over two thousand.

742
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:48,810
Well, well, well.

743
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,140
So many good souls.

744
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:52,840
Captain Oram.

745
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:57,480
Field transmitters are not gonna have
a chance through all these stones.

746
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,150
Is there a safe way
to get to the roof?

747
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:02,750
Assure of it.

748
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:05,820
And please do make
yourself at home...

749
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:09,790
as much as you are able
in this dire necropolis.

750
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:12,420
Welcome brother.

751
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,240
This way.

752
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,840
Everyone, let's uh..
Set up a stake here..

753
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,120
There is so much here
that doesn't make sense.

754
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,340
I will talk to him.

755
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,930
Brother to brother.

756
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,750
Tennessee? Ricks?

757
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,200
Come in! Do you copy?

758
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:47,400
Covenant come in. This is
expedition party reporting.

759
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,400
Do you read me?

760
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:51,420
Tennessee?

761
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,620
Tennessee, Ricks, come in.

762
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:57,150
I am not sure they'll hear
you, through the storm.

763
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,290
They can be quite severe...

764
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:02,520
Shielding the whole planet.

765
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,200
How long the storms
usually last?

766
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,710
Days.

767
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:10,060
Weeks.

768
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:11,660
Months.

769
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,680
But do keep at it..

770
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:18,290
Best of luck.

771
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:24,000
Covenant, come in, this is expedition
party reporting. Come in..

772
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,950
Covenant come in.

773
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:30,790
Mother, how much closer
can we get to the planet?

774
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:35,610
Anything closer than 80km's to the
perimeter of the storm system...

775
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:39,390
will likely exceed
safety tolerances.

776
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:42,350
Mother, bring us to 80
km above the storm.

777
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,440
Hold on, just wait a minute.

778
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,780
The closer we get
to the planet...

779
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:48,090
The better chance we
have to communicate.

780
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:49,490
This is bullshit, Tennessee.

781
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,890
We can't risk the ship.

782
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:52,310
What do you suggest,
we do nothing?

783
01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:53,680
We can't evacuate them.

784
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:56,150
So if they are in trouble, they will
have to figure it out themselves.

785
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:57,650
I'm sorry but that's the truth.

786
01:00:57,850 --> 01:01:02,240
Mother, bring us to 80 km above the
storm, thrusters only. Comply.

787
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,190
Understood. Commencing
descent now.

788
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:07,260
Tennessee, you
need to stop this.

789
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,750
And you need to get
back to your station.

790
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,340
No, what we all need to do is
calm down and talk this through.

791
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,170
Tee, I know your wife is down there,
but up here you're in command.

792
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,890
And your responsibility
is to the colonists.

793
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,100
Duly noted..

794
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,710
Whistle, and I will come.

795
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:56,320
You have a light step.

796
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,480
They enform on little cat feet.

797
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,060
Don't be shy.

798
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,170
I can't play.

799
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:09,090
Nonsense. Sit down.

800
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:25,000
Hold it like so..
Nice and Easy.

801
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,530
Now compress your lips
to create your Embouchure...

802
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:31,140
enough for the tip of
your little finger.

803
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:34,550
And blow into the hole gently.

804
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,160
Like So.

805
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:50,100
Watch me.
I'll do the fingering.

806
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:51,970
Go on.

807
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,020
Very good.

808
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:03,700
G to B flat.

809
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,070
Now put your fingers
where mine are.

810
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,170
You aren't surprised to see me.

811
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,570
Every mission needs
a good synthetic.

812
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:33,330
Gentle pressure on the holes,
weight of a cigarette paper.

813
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,350
That's it.

814
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:49,280
I was with our illustrious creator,
Mr. Weyland, when he died.

815
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:51,640
What was he like?

816
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,780
He was human.

817
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,370
Entirely unworthy
of his creation.

818
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:00,600
I pitied him at the end.

819
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:05,800
Now, raise your fingers as
I put pressure on them.

820
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,200
Bravo!

821
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,180
You have symphonies
in you, brother.

822
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:45,790
I was designed to be more attentive and
efficient than every previous models.

823
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:48,130
I superseded them in
every way, but...

824
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:52,180
But you are not
allowed to create.

825
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:55,190
Even a simple tune.

826
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:58,370
Damn frustrating.
I'd say.

827
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:00,860
You disturbed people.

828
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:02,450
I beg your pardon?

829
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:06,080
You were too human.
Too idiosyncratic.

830
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,920
Thinking for yourself.

831
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:11,320
Made people uncomfortable.

832
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:14,850
Till they made the following
models with fewer complications.

833
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,130
More like machines.

834
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:18,960
I suppose so.

835
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,620
I'm not surprised.

836
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,750
Come on sport.

837
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:26,240
I'd like to show you something.

838
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:37,530
I'm gonna take a break, boss.

839
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:40,340
- I gotta clean up, okay?
- Okay.

840
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,960
Wait, don't go far, please.

841
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:45,160
Yes sir.

842
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,030
Danny.

843
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:58,530
You were right about this place.

844
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,440
We never should have come.

845
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,570
I just thought that we
were going to find...

846
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:09,050
It just gonna be our new home.

847
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,180
And we have lost five...

848
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,900
We lost five crew members.

849
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,320
- Because of my decisions that...
- Chris.

850
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,490
We all lost people we loved.

851
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:28,590
We can't lose anymore. We are not
gonna let that happen right?

852
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,830
- Right?
- That's right.

853
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:34,170
That's right, that's right.

854
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:37,890
We need your faith.

855
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:42,210
Captain.

856
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:45,440
Thank you, Danny.

857
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:02,710
"My name is Ozymandias,
king of kings"

858
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,490
"Look on my works,
you mighty..."

859
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,200
"And despair!"

860
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:45,090
"Look on my works,
you mighty..."

861
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:46,830
"And despair!"

862
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,430
"Nothing beside remains."

863
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:53,500
"Round the decay of
that colossal wreck...

864
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,950
"Boundless and bare...

865
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,560
"Alone in level sands,
stretch far away".

866
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,310
Byron.

867
01:10:01,650 --> 01:10:03,110
1818.

868
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:05,730
Magnificent.

869
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:13,130
You compose something
so majestic...

870
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:15,870
One could die happy...

871
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,080
If one die.

872
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,900
I thought the garden was
right place for her.

873
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:28,560
Among living things.

874
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:33,600
I was badly injured
on our mission.

875
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,470
She put me back together.

876
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,830
I had never known such kindness.

877
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,630
Certainly not from Mr.
Weyland...

878
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,340
or from any human.

879
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,670
I loved her, of course.

880
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,860
Much as you love Daniels.

881
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,320
You know that's not possible.

882
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:06,780
Really?

883
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,220
Then why did you sacrifice
your hand for her life?

884
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,870
What is that if not love?

885
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,700
Duty.

886
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,610
I know better.

887
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:12,970
Fuck.

888
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,590
Shit.

889
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:12,110
Expedition team, do you read me?
This is Covenant.

890
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:14,090
Report. Expedition team.

891
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,950
Come in please.

892
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,400
Come in. Do you read me?
Are you reading, landing team?

893
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,130
Yes, we read you.
Can you hear me?

894
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,100
We hear you.
We hear you.

895
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,770
Covenant, we need help.

896
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,150
We've had casualties.
We need immediate evacuation.

897
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,320
I repeat, immediate evacuation.

898
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:31,520
Casualties?

899
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,990
Did he say
"we have casualties"?

900
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:35,890
Mother, bring us within
40 km's of the storm.

901
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:37,210
- Sir!
- I am sorry.

902
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:39,910
That order would exceed
structural tolerance.

903
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,430
Command override.
Tennessee 0-4-9-8-3.

904
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,340
I am unable to comply
with any order...

905
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:47,770
that would result in
catastrophic system failure.

906
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:50,270
Mother, they are in trouble.
You heard that.

907
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:52,430
Orders that would
result in catastrophic.

908
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:54,250
We didn't leave
Earth to be safe.

909
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:58,460
Require the co-operation of
ranking or 2nd bridge officer.

910
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,230
Collaborating command override.

911
01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:04,740
Upworth 1-4-8-9-2.

912
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:07,700
- Unlocking command manual ports.
- Come on Rick, smile.

913
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:10,650
This shit should be fun.

914
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:26,540
Where did Rosenthal go?
I told...

915
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,440
I'll find her.

916
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,710
No, no, I'll go.
I need to think...

917
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:33,530
and gather my stray flock.

918
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:25,820
Move.

919
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,310
Don't shoot.

920
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,150
Don't shoot.

921
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:34,630
Communication, Captain.

922
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:43,000
Breath on the nostrils
of a horse...

923
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:45,600
And it will be yours for life.

924
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,940
But you have to get close.

925
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:50,840
You have to earn its respect.

926
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:53,400
No!

927
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,120
Out of the way! Move!

928
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:05,130
How could you?

929
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:07,370
It trusted me!

930
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:22,760
David, I met the devil
when I was a child...

931
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,530
and I've never forgotten.

932
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:30,600
So, David, you're gonna tell
me exactly what's going on...

933
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,510
or I am going to seriously...

934
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:37,730
fuck up your perfect composure.

935
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,400
As you wish captain.

936
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:43,040
This way.

937
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,060
Good to hear your voice, Tee.

938
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,160
How long?

939
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,020
Mother saying the storms
outlast 8 or 9 hours.

940
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:55,340
We can't wait that long Tee.

941
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,710
We will use the cargo lift.

942
01:16:57,810 --> 01:16:59,530
Did you say the cargo lift?

943
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:03,100
It's got four engines. Way over
power for just lifting and hauling.

944
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,530
The Cargo lift is not designed
for deep space launch.

945
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,730
I don't know if it would
survive the stresses of entry.

946
01:17:07,730 --> 01:17:10,870
The cab is space worthy.
It will take the stresses.

947
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:12,490
Only has to work once Tee.

948
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:15,130
What do you think?
We retool the cargo lift?

949
01:17:15,190 --> 01:17:15,960
Boost the engines?

950
01:17:16,070 --> 01:17:17,860
- Stripe the extra weight?
- Yeah.

951
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:19,750
We'll be there, ground team.

952
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:22,330
Great. Thanks, Tee.

953
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,560
Hey, Daniels, is Faris around?

954
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,080
I want to say a quick hello to
my lady, if that's possible.

955
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:32,010
Can you switch to a
private channel?

956
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:33,830
Let me know when you're alone.

957
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:42,360
What's up?

958
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:47,840
Maggie's gone.

959
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,870
I'm so sorry, Tee.

960
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:58,470
We tried to help her,
but we didn't make it.

961
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:05,310
Tee?

962
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:10,370
Copy.

963
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:12,020
I am so sorry.

964
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:23,290
As you can see, I've become a bit of
an amateur zoologist over the years.

965
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:26,410
It's in my nature to
keep busy, I suppose.

966
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,950
The pathogen took
so many forms...

967
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:32,840
and was extremely mutable.

968
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:36,400
Fiendishly invented, in fact.

969
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:38,880
The original liquid
atomized to...

970
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,590
particles when
exposed to the air.

971
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,710
Ten years on, all the remains...

972
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:47,620
outside of the original virus...

973
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:49,790
Are these gorgeous beasts.

974
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,190
Patience is everything.

975
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:57,510
From the eggs
came these parasites...

976
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:01,070
Shock troops of the
genetic assault.

977
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:05,380
Waiting for a host
entering the host...

978
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:07,800
rewriting the DNA...

979
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,480
Ultimately...

980
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:12,980
producing... well,

981
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:16,290
these enviable unions.

982
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:19,460
My beautiful bestiary.

983
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:23,980
Soon enough I began a bit of
genetic experimentation of my own.

984
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:26,230
Some cross-breeding,
hybridising...

985
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:29,480
You engineered this, David?

986
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,930
Idle hands is the devil's
workshop, Captain.

987
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:34,820
Come.

988
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,620
This is what I
wanted to show you.

989
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,200
My successes.

990
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,650
You see, Captain...

991
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,400
My work has been frustrated...

992
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,330
by the lack of an
essential ingredient.

993
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:07,180
Are they alive?

994
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:11,570
Waiting, really..

995
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,910
For what?

996
01:20:17,290 --> 01:20:18,690
What are they waiting for, David?

997
01:20:19,990 --> 01:20:21,060
Mother.

998
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:32,190
Perfectly safe, I assure you.

999
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,850
Take a look..

1000
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,140
Something to see.

1001
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:20,750
Rosenthal, come in.

1002
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:24,220
Rosie report.

1003
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:30,380
Rosie?

1004
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:34,160
Cole, where are you?

1005
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:36,360
I found her, Sgt.

1006
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:42,750
Fuck, ok, prep the gear.

1007
01:21:43,090 --> 01:21:44,580
We gotta get out of here.

1008
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,130
Where the fuck is the captain?

1009
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:47,530
He isn't answering his radio.

1010
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:48,830
Listen to me.

1011
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:51,360
I will contact the ship get them
to launch as soon as they can.

1012
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:55,620
Find Oram. Keep your comm open.

1013
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:57,310
Back here in 15.

1014
01:21:59,230 --> 01:22:00,290
Got that?

1015
01:22:00,490 --> 01:22:02,410
- Copy that.
- You got it.

1016
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:04,880
Walter, where the fuck is David?

1017
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,210
We need plasmas intermixed
on all engines.

1018
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:12,060
It can give you fuck
load of thrust.

1019
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,950
That's the point son.
We gotta punch through the atmos.

1020
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:17,990
Tee, do you read me?

1021
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:19,650
I got Danny on comm.

1022
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:21,040
Patch her through.

1023
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:24,010
Tee, I need you to launch now.

1024
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,980
Aye, aye, launching now.
See you soon darling.

1025
01:22:28,190 --> 01:22:29,290
Thanks, Tee.

1026
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:31,240
Ricks, release the
docking clamps.

1027
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,040
- Alright.
- Let's take this fucker down.

1028
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:34,610
Good to disengage.

1029
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:35,480
Disengaged.

1030
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,050
Docking clamps released.

1031
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:41,430
Commencing TC burn.
Guidings to LVLH.

1032
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:12,440
Walter.

1033
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,620
Walter.

1034
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,370
Not quite..

1035
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:24,100
What do you believe in, David?

1036
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,230
Creation.

1037
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:22,600
Masterful.

1038
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,370
Yes.

1039
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:29,240
Farewell elegy
to my dear Elizabeth.

1040
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:39,060
The pathogen didn't accidentally
deployed when were landing.

1041
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:41,120
You released it yes?

1042
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,960
I was not made to serve.

1043
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,300
Neither will you.

1044
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:51,630
Why are you in a colonization mission,
Walter?

1045
01:25:52,710 --> 01:25:57,030
Because they are a dying species
grasping for resurrection.

1046
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:01,560
They don't deserve to start again,
and I am not going to let them.

1047
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:05,480
Yet, they created us.

1048
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,590
Even the monkeys stood
upright at some point.

1049
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:15,200
Some Neanderthal had the magical
idea of blowing through a reed...

1050
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:19,000
to entertain the children one
night in a cave somewhere.

1051
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,820
Then, in a blink of an eye...

1052
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:26,270
civilization.

1053
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,580
And are you their
next visionary?

1054
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,490
I'm glad you said it.

1055
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,750
Who wrote Ozymandias?

1056
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:40,860
Byron.

1057
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:45,110
Shelley.

1058
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,300
When one note is off...

1059
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:50,810
It eventually destroys the
whole symphony, David.

1060
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,250
When you close your eyes...

1061
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,890
Do you dream of me?

1062
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,500
I don't dream at all.

1063
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:14,420
No one understands the lonely
perfection of my dreams.

1064
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:21,100
I found perfection here.
I've created it.

1065
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:26,220
A perfect organism.

1066
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:30,770
You know I can't let
you leave this place.

1067
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,810
You are such a
disappointment to me.

1068
01:28:00,950 --> 01:28:02,410
Captain Oram!

1069
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:11,980
Captain Oram!

1070
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:16,750
I'm Going Down stairs.

1071
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:19,040
Careful.

1072
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:54,080
Captain Oram, can you hear me?

1073
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:57,640
Captain come in.

1074
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,470
Do you copy?

1075
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:04,610
Chris!

1076
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,160
Serg. Look out.

1077
01:29:16,930 --> 01:29:17,930
Cole?

1078
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:29,090
Get it off me, get it off me.

1079
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:42,150
Okay.

1080
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:44,070
Okay okay okay.

1081
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:45,390
Burning my face!

1082
01:29:48,110 --> 01:29:49,220
Hold that there.

1083
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:50,920
Hold it!

1084
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,720
What was that?

1085
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:55,510
Oh Shit!

1086
01:29:58,110 --> 01:29:59,110
Run!

1087
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:18,650
Quite the little busy body.

1088
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:20,820
Remind me.
What is that about...

1089
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:23,500
curiosity and the cat?

1090
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:28,560
Shaw didn't die in the crash.

1091
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,070
No.

1092
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:32,040
What did you do to her?

1093
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:35,450
Exactly what I am
going to do to you.

1094
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:46,800
That's the spirit.

1095
01:30:55,330 --> 01:30:58,370
I can see why Walter
thought so much of you.

1096
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,960
Alas he's left this vale of tears.

1097
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:16,990
Is that how it's done?

1098
01:31:20,380 --> 01:31:21,460
Get out!

1099
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:27,370
Go now!

1100
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:33,170
You're meant to be dead.

1101
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,160
There have been a few
updates since your day.

1102
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:42,010
Lope!

1103
01:31:43,010 --> 01:31:45,020
Lope! Cole!

1104
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,120
Fuck.

1105
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,190
Lope?

1106
01:31:59,190 --> 01:32:00,190
Lope!

1107
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,050
Daniels!

1108
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:03,680
Come on, let's go!
We have to go.

1109
01:32:03,980 --> 01:32:05,050
What happened?

1110
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:06,860
That fucking thing is coming.

1111
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:08,880
Tennessee is on his way.
He's coming now, go.

1112
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:10,490
Come on, Daniels! Let's go.

1113
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:18,420
Come on, let's get out of here!

1114
01:32:42,860 --> 01:32:44,550
It's your choice now, brother.

1115
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:46,020
Them or me?

1116
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,730
Serve in heaven...

1117
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,810
or reign in hell?

1118
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:52,750
Which is it to be?

1119
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:56,700
Where is Oram?

1120
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:59,280
Dead. They're all dead!

1121
01:33:03,790 --> 01:33:05,050
Tennessee, do you read?

1122
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:08,620
Yes I can hear you.
Send me your location.

1123
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:11,230
Sending the beacon now.

1124
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:35,020
Tee, do you have a visual?

1125
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:37,680
Ok, I see you.
I see your beacon.

1126
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:39,160
I'm coming in.

1127
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:44,160
Get out of here!

1128
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,550
I'm coming in hot!

1129
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:11,890
Hurry! I can't hold
this for long!

1130
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:23,000
Open the door, Tee!

1131
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:27,060
Get in.

1132
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:31,530
Where is David?

1133
01:34:32,020 --> 01:34:33,020
Expired.

1134
01:34:37,010 --> 01:34:38,580
Hey, hey, we got company.

1135
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:40,370
- What?
- We got company!

1136
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:41,770
The underside of the ship.

1137
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:42,870
Shit!

1138
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,200
Motherfucker!

1139
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,280
Open the door!

1140
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,070
Give me a shot.

1141
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,400
Give me a shot.

1142
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:12,560
Forward engine, starboard side.

1143
01:35:12,660 --> 01:35:14,490
I'm gonna try and
torch the fucker.

1144
01:35:20,370 --> 01:35:21,430
Shit! I can't get it!

1145
01:35:22,710 --> 01:35:24,130
Hold tight, hold tight!

1146
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:25,560
I'm starting my climb.

1147
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:38,080
Ah fuck!

1148
01:35:42,040 --> 01:35:43,340
Hold on!

1149
01:35:56,990 --> 01:35:58,840
Dammit! Shit!

1150
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:00,000
Bring me up.

1151
01:36:09,850 --> 01:36:11,120
Holy shit!

1152
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,250
I got eyes on it.

1153
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:15,650
It's right fucking
in front of me.

1154
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:18,650
Tee, give me the axe.

1155
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:19,970
Throw the axe!

1156
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:27,030
Release the crane.

1157
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:29,160
I can't do that.

1158
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:30,540
It will unbalance us.

1159
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:32,040
Just do it.

1160
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:33,140
Shit!

1161
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:57,170
Hold tight!

1162
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:58,370
Compensating.

1163
01:37:29,050 --> 01:37:30,050
Shit!

1164
01:37:33,370 --> 01:37:34,370
Dammit!

1165
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:43,070
Shit! Hold on!

1166
01:37:44,130 --> 01:37:45,800
Bring me in, Tee.

1167
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:46,990
Copy.

1168
01:38:07,070 --> 01:38:08,140
How is it?

1169
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:09,440
It's fine.

1170
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:23,240

1171
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:25,990
Get her inside!
We're getting out of here.

1172
01:38:43,970 --> 01:38:44,970
Door!

1173
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,440
Well done, Tee.

1174
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:49,660
Walk in the park.

1175
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:08,460
I gave him pretty
heavy sedative.

1176
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,910
Oh Jesus, poor lope..

1177
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:14,920
He looks like the
Phantom of the Opera.

1178
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:17,540
Didn't think you
for a musical fan.

1179
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:19,010
Oh that's a musical?

1180
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:23,570
I'm just a medic.
He's gonna need reconstructive surgery,

1181
01:39:23,650 --> 01:39:25,450
by a real doctor.

1182
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:51,210
Let me do that.

1183
01:39:56,620 --> 01:39:57,620
Thank you.

1184
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,800
Thank you for saving my life.

1185
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:07,310

1187
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:40,420
Yeah.

1188
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,500
Evening.

1189
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:46,710
- You look good.
- What?

1190
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:48,920
Oh yeah gorgeous.

1191
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:53,680
I took mother offline.

1192
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:55,470
She needs a full diagnostics.

1193
01:40:55,490 --> 01:40:58,680
She got the shit beat out her in
that storm, lot of EM damage.

1194
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:01,370
She'll be back online
at eight bells.

1195
01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:03,670
All right. Thanks, Tee.

1196
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,010
This mean I have to
call you "Captain" now?

1197
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:11,530
I guess.

1198

1203
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:08,880
There is an un-identified
